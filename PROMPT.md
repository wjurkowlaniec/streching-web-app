make ma simple website with timer that tracks neck streching with following times


chin back 5 seconds, 25 reps
10s break
left turn neck 20s 3 reps
10s break
right turn neck 20s 3 reps
10s break
left angle forward 20s 3 reps
10s break
right angle forward 20s 3 reps


I want to see it on the list, with timer moving automatically, give me full remaining time and change to next one automatically. website clean, minimal


make it that I can have separate file for config that I can choose streching excercises and configure more pages with different sets. 


Optional images for each section, there are in images directory, this will be called "neck"


can be json file, need to be easly deployable, might be a script that will generate  in _release


_release/neck 
_release/legs  etc 



cleanest code possible, minimal, deploy script, might be python made, static websites, mobile friendsly, minimal interface

deployment files should be one file ideally, also minimal html, newest standards

also it should be possible to select different staring point when you click on the list below 

generate simple readme, and how to run.
